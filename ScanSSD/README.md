# ScanSSD: Scanning Single Shot Detector for Math in Document Images


A [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of ScanSSD [Scanning Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://paragmali.me/scanning-single-shot-detector-for-math-in-document-images/) by [**Parag Mali**](https://github.com/MaliParag/). It was developed using SSD implementation by [**Max deGroot**](https://github.com/amdegroot).

All credit goes to the authors of the paper and the original implementation.

I have made some changes to the original implementation to make it work with the latest version of PyTorch and Python. 
I have also removed some unnecessary files, in particular the ones related to dataset.
